             <h2 align = "center"> Information about Naloxone </h2>
             <p align = "center">Naloxone is a FDA - approved medication commonly
referred to as the 'opioid antagonist'. It is used to counteract the
effects of opioid overdoses, specifically, life-threatening overdose effects
that would otherwise not let an overdose victim breathe correctly. Naloxone
is a non-addictive medication that can be administered through the nose and
purchased over the counter. Naloxone will only work on people that have
opioids in their system and will not have any negative side effects on
non-opioid users if administered. It is a temporary drug that wears off in
minutes.  Naloxone comes in many forms to administer however the most rapid
is via nasal administration.  We recommend using the nasal form given its
rapid ease of administration and simplicity.</p>

					<p align = "center">                   
Opioids are a class of medications that specializes in pain relief. Opioids
essentially reduce pain by lessening the intensity of the pain signals
reaching the brain. Several different medications fall under this class,
some of the more common ones are hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and
codeine. These medications are used for an array of different pain
scenarios, such as, injury-related pain and pain from post-surgical
procedures. No matter what the opioid prescribed is, excessive use of an
opioid can be fatal. </p>

wearable-integrated, vital monitoring application aimed at helping solve the
opioid overdose epidemic. The goal of this application is help opioid users
overcome deadly overdoses by monitoring vital signs through wearable
technology. LifeKit aims to detect overdoses before fatal incidents happen
and save lives by sending alerts to nearby emergency responders, naloxone
carriers, family members, and doctors. </p>

application as an opioid user. After registration is complete, a short
tutorial and calibration with your integrated wearable device will be
required. You're all set to go, simply keep the application running the
background and have your wearable device on you during opioid usage. </p>
